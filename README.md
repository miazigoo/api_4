### How to install

* Download the script 
* [Register on the website](https://api.nasa.gov) - and get a token of the format: ```ecbb0fa2d11d009c022dd9042f7bbe28f0f3bb60``` (<=the token is not valid). You can use the built-in demo token
* In the file ```main.py``` you can substitute your api token instead of the demo

Python3 should already be installed. 
Use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the file from the console:
```
python main.py 
```
